Mastermind Game project in Ruby - assignment by The Odin Project

A Game of Mastermind against a Computer, built using Ruby as an
educational project.

MasterMind is a code-breaking game between two players.

The Code Maker creates a code pattern using a set of pre-defined
colors.
The Code Breaker attempts to guess the pattern, in both order and color,
within 8 - 12 turns.

After each guess, feedback is provided to the code breaker to inform
them if any of their choices are the correct color, and if any correct
colors are in the correct position.
